# Polynomial Regression in 30 Lines of Python

Tried to write a python script that performs polynomial regression using gradient descent in a minimal number of lines of code.It might take a long time to converge depending on how many points you are trying to plot. But you should experiment with number of epochs and step size. If you get an error, it means that your step size is too large.
